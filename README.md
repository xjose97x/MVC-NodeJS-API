# MVC-NodeJS-API

Welcome!

In this repo you'll find a template on how to build an MVC API with NodeJS.
I have not added a view folder since as an API it has no view setup. You should be able to by serving static files, thought.

I created this repo because after long time searching how to do this, I never found a great example, so I decided to do it myself.
Server.js is the starting point of the program.
DbConnection.js is where you're supposed to setup your MongoDB connection string.
